### Advanced AI Architecture Enhancement
**Multi-Agent Collaboration System**

The current implementation uses a single-agent architecture. With more development time, the system could be enhanced with a multi-agent collaboration architecture:

**Proposed Architecture:**
```
Task Orchestrator Agent
    ├── Patent Structure Analyst Agent
    │   └── Specializes in claim structure, dependencies, and formatting
    ├── Technical Accuracy Agent
    │   └── Validates technical terms, consistency, and prior art references
    ├── Legal Compliance Agent
    │   └── Ensures legal language compliance and regulatory requirements
    ├── Diagram Generation Agent
    │   └── Creates flowcharts, system diagrams, and technical illustrations
    └── Quality Assurance Agent
        └── Reviews outputs from other agents for coherence and accuracy
```

**Benefits of Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- **Higher Quality Suggestions**: Each agent specializes in specific aspects of patent analysis
- **More Robust Diagram Generation**: Dedicated agent for visual content with deeper understanding
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new specialized agents for emerging requirements
- **Improved Accuracy**: Cross-validation between agents reduces errors
- **Context Preservation**: Agents can share context while maintaining specialization

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Define clear interfaces between agents
2. Implement message passing and coordination protocols
3. Create specialized prompts for each agent role
4. Build consensus mechanisms for conflicting suggestions
5. Develop agent performance monitoring and optimization

This enhancement would significantly improve the system's ability to provide comprehensive, accurate, and contextually appropriate patent review assistance.

### Security Improvements
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Security headers
