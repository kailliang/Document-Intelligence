## 💡 Core Features

### 1. Document Version Control System
- **Git-like versioning**: Create, switch, and manage document versions
- **Diff tracking**: Visual comparison between versions
- **Atomic saves**: Transaction-based updates with rollback capability
- **History persistence**: Complete audit trail of all changes

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis Engine
```typescript
// Real-time AI suggestion system with streaming
const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState<Suggestion[]>([]);
const { sendJsonMessage, lastJsonMessage, readyState } = useWebSocket(WS_URL);

// Intelligent text matching with fuzzy search fallback
const findTextInDocument = (doc: Document, searchText: string) => {
  // Multiple search strategies for robust text location
  return findExactMatch(doc, searchText) || 
         findFuzzyMatch(doc, searchText) || 
         findContextualMatch(doc, searchText);
};
```

### 3. Interactive Suggestion System
- **Inline suggestion cards** with accept/reject workflow
- **Confidence scoring** for AI recommendations
- **Batch processing** for multiple suggestions
- **Undo/redo** support with command pattern

### 4. Advanced Diagram Integration
- **Mermaid diagram support** with custom TipTap extension
- **AI-generated flowcharts** from natural language
- **SVG optimization** for PDF export
- **Responsive scaling** for various screen sizes

### 5. Enterprise PDF Export
- **Playwright-based rendering** for pixel-perfect output
- **Asynchronous processing** with progress tracking
- **Security features**: Path validation, sanitization
- **Auto-cleanup** with configurable retention

## Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced AI triggers**: Intelligent 1-second delay to reduce API calls
- **Virtual scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large documents
- **Code splitting**: Lazy loading of heavy components
- **Memoization**: Strategic use of React.memo and useMemo
- **Connection pooling**: Reusable WebSocket connections

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Initial Load**: < 2s (optimized bundle size ~350KB gzipped)
- **AI Response Time**: < 500ms for suggestions
- **PDF Export**: < 3s for 20-page documents
- **WebSocket Latency**: < 100ms round-trip
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes, < 50ms average

## 🔒 Security Implementation

- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS protection with DOMPurify
- **CORS Configuration**: Whitelist-based origin control
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Secure file operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm for API protection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation without exposing internals

## 🚦 Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Quick start with development scripts
./start-dev.sh    # Starts both frontend and backend
./logs-dev.sh     # Monitor service status
./stop-dev.sh     # Clean shutdown

# Manual setup for debugging
cd client && npm run dev     # Frontend on :3000
cd server && uvicorn app.__main__:app --reload  # Backend on :8080
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing on PR
- Type checking and linting
- Build verification
- Docker image creation
- Deployment to staging
```
